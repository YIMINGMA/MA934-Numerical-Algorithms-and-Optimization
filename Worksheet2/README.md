# Exercises for MA934

## Sorting algorithms

This worksheet explores some of the issues around sorting algorithms and
benckmarking of code in Julia.

## Update

If you'd like to run a single ```.jl``` file to generate all results (including sorting results and plots), just use Julia/JuliPro to execute ```MA934Sorting.jl``` as a script.

However, if you prefer to see the results in an interactive mode, open Jupyter Notebook and run the ```Class-2.ipynb``` file in it. The module I created for this Notebook is called ```Utilities.jl```.


### Feedback from Colm

Hi Yiming. Excellent work here. Very clear, well commented and neat code and excellent presentation of your results. I liked that you sorted some apples and bananas :-) Keep up the good work.

I decided to run the interactive version and everything went smoothly. I was curious whether you used a tool to generate the script version or you did it by hand?

### Score: 10/10

### Reply from Yiming

Hi Colm! Thank you for your feedback, and also, thank you for spending time carefully scrutinizing the code. I wrote functions in Jupyter Notebook first, and after testing them, I move them to a ```.jl``` file by copy & paste.

Hope you can have a good evening!



Best wishes,
